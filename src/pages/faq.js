    {
      question: "How quickly can you buy my property?",
      answer: <p>We can complete the purchase in as little as 7 days from initial contact. However, we can also work to your preferred timeline if you need more time. Our flexible approach means we can accommodate your needs, whether you're looking for a quick sale or need a specific completion date.</p>
    },
    {
      question: "How does the process work?",
      answer: <p>Our process is simple and transparent: First, you contact us with details about your property. We then conduct a quick market analysis and provide you with a free, no-obligation cash offer within 48 hours. If you accept, we handle all the legal paperwork and can complete the purchase with you paying no fees, no chain to worry about, and no risk of last-minute fall-throughs.</p>
    },
    {
      question: "Will you buy any property?",
      answer: <p>Yes, we consider properties in any condition and in any location across the UK. Whether your property is in pristine condition or requires significant renovation, we can make you a fair offer. We've bought everything from studio apartments to large family homes, including properties with structural issues, short leases, or non-standard construction types.</p>
    },
    {
      question: "How much will you offer for my property?",
      answer: <p>Our offers are typically between 75-85% of the full market value. While this is below what you might achieve on the open market in ideal conditions, it reflects the significant benefits we provide: guaranteed sale, no fees (we cover all legal costs), no viewings or repairs needed, and the speed and certainty we offer. For many sellers, the savings in time, stress, and carrying costs make our service valuable.</p>
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any fees to pay?",
      answer: <p>No. We cover all costs associated with the sale, including legal fees, valuation costs, and any other expenses typically associated with selling a property. The price we offer is exactly what you'll receive â€“ there are no hidden charges or deductions.</p>
    },
    {
      question: "Is there any obligation when I request an offer?",
      answer: <p>Absolutely not. When you request an offer from us, there's no obligation to proceed. We provide a free valuation and cash offer with no strings attached. You're free to take as much time as you need to consider our offer, and you can walk away at any point if you decide it's not right for you.</p>
    },
    {
      question: "I'm in a property chain that's at risk of breaking down. Can you help?",
      answer: <p>Yes, this is a common situation we assist with. If you're caught in a property chain and your buyer has pulled out or is causing delays, we can step in as cash buyers to keep your onward purchase on track. Our ability to complete quickly means we can often save chains that would otherwise collapse, preventing you from losing your dream home.</p>
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to prepare or repair my property before selling?",
      answer: <p>No, one of the key benefits of selling to us is that we buy properties in their current condition. There's no need to redecorate, make repairs, or even clean before completion. This saves you time, stress, and potentially thousands in repair costs that might be demanded by traditional buyers.</p>
